# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

	In my website, I wanted to make it easier to people to understand the new coronavirus disease, by giving them informations about it: what are the disease symptoms, mortality rates, etc. I have been learning a lot of new things in this course, and I will do much better in project1. Thanks a lot.

Looking forward,
Thiago Costa Mota.
